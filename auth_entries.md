âœ… What You Do Need to Do:
To pass auth checks in Soroban contracts:

Include the target address (e.g. buyer) as an argument

Inside contract: use buyer.require_auth();

Simulate the transaction before signing

The simulation tells you what auth_entries are needed

You then construct a tx that includes those auth_entries

User signs using their wallet (e.g., Freighter)

In here, we see that noting is returned from the simulation for the auth value.
